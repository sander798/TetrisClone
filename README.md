A basic Tetris clone written in Odin using Raylib, using no example projects for reference (as a personal challenge).

Play by using the command `odin run .` in the downloaded directory, assuming you have Odin installed.

Controls:
- Arrow keys to move
- Space to drop
- Left-shift to rotate
- Escape to quit
